<h4>1. Add Contacts and Their Information</h4>
<h5>Before any Alerts can be created, you must first add at least one contact and their information.</h5>
<h5>You currently have {{ con_length }} contacts saved.</h5>
<p>Tip: If you just want to test the system before using it, just add your own contact information.</p>
<button type="button" onclick="/contacts">Click Here to Add/Edit Contacts</button>
<h4>2. Choose Recurring or Pre-Scheduled Alert Type and Create a New Alert Set</h4>
<h6>All Alert types require you to check-in with the app <a href="/check_ins">here</a>, over SMS (at [1]415-800-1883), or over e-mail (checkin@safeworkproject.org'). </h6>
<h6>If an alert-set is active, the check-in requirements/alerts will apply to any day they are in use. If you are concerned you might forget to deactivate an alert-set, set the "End Date" to be the last day you forsee using the alert-set and even when activated, those alerts cannot be sent after that date.</h6>
<h5>A. Recurring Alert Set</h5>
<p>A recurring alert set requires you to check-in with the app every pre-set time interval. For example, if you set it to require a check-in every 2 hours (120 minutes) and you activated it at 7:30PM, you would need to check-in at least once before 9:30PM, then again between 11:30PM, then 1:30AM, etc. until you miss a check-in and your alert is sent OR you deactivate the Alert Set. This alert set type is ideal if you aren't sure of your schedule/plans and are going out to work (or date) and see what you find.</p>
<h5>B. (Pre-)Scheduled Alert Set</h5>
<p>A scheduled alert set allows you to pre-set alerts(/check-in requirements) by time. You will be required to check-in within 1 hour (60 minutes) before each check-in time or that specific alert will be sent to your contacts. For example, if you set an alert for 8:00PM and 2:15AM, you will need to check in between 7:00 and 8:00PM and then again between 1:15 and 2:15AM. If an earlier scheduled alert is missed, the following check-ins are still required to prevent the alerts from being send, unless you deactivate the alert set in use. This alert set type is ideal if you know your schedule and want some backup in case something goes wrong. For example, if you have a date at 7:00PM and it is supposed to be 2 hours, you could set a check-in for 7:30 so you can double-check you met the client and he seems alright. You could then set another check-in for 9:30 to make sure you got out alright, or 10:00 to make sure you got home alright. If you miss a check-in, if you include where you are going in your message, your contacts will be easily able to find you!</p>

<h1>SafeWalk Safety Alert Sets</h1>
	<b>Adding an Alert Set: Do you want your alert set to require recurring check-ins (by a certain time interval) or pre-set check-ins with scheduled pre-set times?</b> Recurring check-ins are best if you aren't sure of your schedule when you go out to work (like with most who work the street). Pre-set check-ins are best if you have a known schedule and/or date with a client. In that case, you can require check-ins shortly after arriving, when the date should end, and/or some period after that (in case you aren't sure of the end time).<br>
